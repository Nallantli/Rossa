Rossa is a general purpose scripting language with varying capabilities. It is powerful in its own right, but additionally has the ability to further augment itself with C++ libraries and bindings.

The language is still deeply in its developmental stage. It has gone through two previous iterations that were abandoned for lack of fulfilling the absolute goal of the language itself. The first iteration was belabored by heavy memory usage, and the second by extremely strict static typing. The newest iteration attempts to find a common ground between both approaches while mainting the simplicity of the original outline.

This document will attempt to outline the features and standard libraries.
