# Regarding Name Change

_Ruota_ had been the name of the previous attempt to construct a programming language. While this language is a spiritual successor to this attempt, it has by now reached a point at which there are significant divergences between the two in structure, syntax, and underlying processes. For this reason I have decided to designate a new name to this and future iterations of the language.

The name is derived from the color scheme used by the language. Thus, _Ruota Rossa_, i.e. _Red Ruota_.
